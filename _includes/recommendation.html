Kratika has shown amazing initiative, going above and beyond what was asked of her. Thanks to her inquisitiveness, we are experimenting with exciting new directions. In this project, Kratika has implemented and modified state-of-the-art deep learning models using TensorFlow. I have been impressed by Kratika's ability to learn and dedication to finding solutions. Further, Kratika is a valuable team member and a pleasure to work with. I can't wait to see what else Kratika achieves on this project and in future roles.</p>

                                  Kratika successfully worked in a project called "Smart Shuffle". Shuffle is a time-consuming and complex operation that is part of a large amount of Big Data queries. During her tenure with Futurewei Technologies, Kratika quickly became familiar with the Shuffle protocol in Spark, which consists of thousands of lines of Scala and Java code, displaying her ability
                                  to learn new concepts in a short amount of time. She also helped in the design, implementation, testing, and evaluation of three new Shuffle protocols on top of the Spark baseline one. These new shuffle protocols managed in some cases to achieve up to 20% reduction in query execution time. Kratika gained valuable experience in the Software Development Life Cycle from this project and showed amazing software skills while working on a large Spark codebase.<br/> Her perseverance and her positive attitude during the harsh times of a pandemic, is what I admired the most about Kratika. She managed to successfully finish her tenure with Futurewei despite working remotely in a completely new setting and project and with limited resources and equipment due to the pandemic. This is a true statement to her will to learn and create new solutions even if the environment is not ideal.<br/>
                                    Kratika would be a great asset to companies looking for Data Scientists or Data Engineers and I would highly recommend her for these roles.</p>

She combined theoretical knowledge and practical skills so well thus she was always capable of coming up with multiple ways to solve the challenges. Plus she was responsible and active in teamwork and Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™ll fit in and make contributions to every team.</p>
